## Plaintext and FOSS :fox_face:

Last week, we all learned how to use GitHub. This week, we will be learning about aspects of software that go hand in hand with GitHub. That is, how do people know what to do with open-source projects? If someone visited the repo that you made last week, how would they _know what it does_ or _how to contribute to it_? You'll know the answer to both these questions _and more_ by the end of today. Then, you'll apply that knowledge to the repo you made and submit it by next week.

There are a lot of readings for this week, and they're all in the lecture notebook. Check them out!

## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In JupyterLab, open a Launcher and select `Terminal`
4. Type in `cd CMPINF0010`
    - Or, **if you named your class folder something different**, replace `CMPINF0010` with whatever you named your folder
5. Now, copy and paste this command into the terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/week-7.git
    ```
    - If you can't seem to paste anything, try using Ctrl+Shift+V (or Command+Shift+V)
6. You should see a new folder named `week-7` inside your class folder

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Submitting your finished lab

This lab is due at 11:59 PM the night before your next lab session. You'll need to fill out the repo submission form (here)[https://forms.gle/WKFD3DTnQEWfvuvT8].

Notes: 
- This form is different from last week!-
- Only fill this form out _once_ per group! 
- **Include the _full URL_ to your repo when filling it out!** There's no way for me to reach it otherwise.
