## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems. That being said, only email YOUR TA! Office hours are on Discord and Zoom. If none of the times for for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.


## Plaintext and FOSS :fox_face:

Last week, we all learned how to use GitHub. This week, we will be learning about aspects of software that go hand in hand with GitHub. That is, how do people know what to do with open-source projects? If someone visited the repo that you made last week, how would they _know what it does_ or _how to contribute to it_? You'll know the answer to both these questions _and more_ by the end of today. Then, you'll apply that knowledge to the repo you made and submit it by next week.

There are a lot of readings for this week, and they're all in the lecture notebook. Check them out!

## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Week 7` and click where is says `Click Here!`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Submitting your finished lab

This lab is due at 11:59 PM the Sunday before your next lab session. You'll be submitting your GitHub repo!

To submit: copy the URL of your repo and submit it to Canvas. Each group member needs to do this.
