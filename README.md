## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems. That being said, only email YOUR TA! Office hours are on Discord and Zoom. If none of the times for for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.


## Plaintext and FOSS :fox_face:

Last week, we all learned how to use GitHub. This week, we will be learning about aspects of software that go hand in hand with GitHub. That is, how do people know what to do with open-source projects? If someone visited the repo that you made last week, how would they _know what it does_ or _how to contribute to it_? You'll know the answer to both these questions _and more_ by the end of today. Then, you'll apply that knowledge to the repo you made and submit it by next week.

There are a lot of readings for this week, and they're all in the lecture notebook. Check them out!

## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab to
3. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/lab-6.git` and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called lab-6)
5. Launch the desired notebook

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Submitting your finished lab

To submit: copy the URL of your repo and submit it to Canvas. **Each group member** needs to do this.
