Code of Conduct:
We used the Contributor Covenant as our code of conduct because we believe it provides a detailed and fair standard.
The Contributor Covenant is very detailed when describing how the code will be enforced and what is expected of the community members.
We also believe that the enforcement guidelines are fair. It doesn't call for immediate bans and leaves room if there was just a misunderstanding.
